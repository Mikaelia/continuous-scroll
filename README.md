## Running React on Repl.it

[React](https://reactjs.org/) is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is a blazing fast frontend build tool that includes features like Hot Module Reloading (HMR), optimized builds, and TypeScript support out of the box.

Using the two in conjunction is one of the fastest ways to build a web app.

### Getting Started

- Hit run
- Edit [App.tsx](#src/App.tsx) and watch it live update!

Notes:

- Would want to handle prefers reduced motion
- Modal would require proper keyboard handling, closing
- Experience would be better with an initial offset in pills
- responsivity
- something like styled components could have been used to prevent collisions etc.
- Modal dismiss with esc / clicking off
- in prod labels localized

  TODO

- newlines in text
- review useMemo
- reactivity e.g. modal data
